# ds-global-monitoring-explore

This repo contains exploratory work related to the [pa-global-monitoring repository](https://github.com/OCHA-DAP/pa-global-monitoring). As **pa-global-monitoring** is already set up with `{renv}` and `GH Actions` to send emails according to CRON scheduled jobs, this repo was created to explore additional topics without cluttering that repo with additional dependencies.
